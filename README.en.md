# osx64

[中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

A 64-bit operating system implemented in C language, capable of running on virtual machine Bochs 2.7 and physical machines (Intel CPU) platforms. It is being developed as a tutorial and will be published on Douyin (nickname: miao~) and Bilibili (nickname: 计算机八卦) platforms.

## Progress
- [x] Environment setup | [doc](./doc/0环境安装.md)

## Bootloader

* Bootloader (Intel x86-specific)
* GRUB bootloader (cross-platform bootloader)

## Kernel
- [x] Basic goals: memory management, task management, file management, network implementation

- [x] Extended goals: Adding fancy graphical windows, porting programming languages, implementing high-performance database services, creating small games, etc.

## Suitable for
You can use this project to enhance your programming skills and gain in-depth knowledge about low-level systems. It is suitable for those with a basic understanding of the C language (mandatory), and an interest in the underlying principles of operating systems.
